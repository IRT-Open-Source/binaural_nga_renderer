class OverlapSaveConvolver(object):

    Parameters:
        block_size (int): time domain block size for input and output blocks
        nchannels (int): number of channels to process
        f (array of (n, nchannels) floats): specification of nchannels length n
            FIR filters to convolve the input channels with.
    Attributes:
        block_size (int): time domain block size for input and output blocks
        filter_blocks_fd (list of complex arrays): blocks of block_size samples
            of the filter, padded to 2*block_size and fft-ed
        blocks_fd (list of complex arrays): The filter state; blocks_fd[i] will
            form the output in i blocks time, so each input block is multiplied
            by filter_blocks_fd[i] and summed into blocks_fd[i]. After each
            block this queue is rotated to maintain this invariant.
        input_block (array of (block_size*2, nchannels) floats): input to the
            forward fft; the first half contains the input for this block, and the
            second half contains the input from the previous block, so that the
            first half of each block in blocks_fd will contain the tail from the
            previous block.
